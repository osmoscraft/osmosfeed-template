        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hashnode is a free platform for developer blogging. Say you’ve just finished an ambitious project and want to write about 10 important lessons you’ve learned as a developer during it. You should definitely blog it—I love that kind of blog post, myself. Making a jump into the technical debt of operating your own blog isn’t a small choice, but it’s important to own your own content. With Hashnode, the decision gets a lot easier. You can blog under a site you entirely own, and at the same time, reap the benefits of hosted software tailor-made for developer blogging and be part of a social center around developer writing.
